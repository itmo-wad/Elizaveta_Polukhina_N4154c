## Description
I create page using html and css. There is some information about me, images with Pokemon and stars. Also you can see the time that you access to this page.
1. url_for() - helps to serve static components 
2. render_template(template, **parametrs) - this method renders out template with specified parameters. In this work parameters are access time and student name. 
3. redirect() - is used to redirect from url (/) to (/profile)
